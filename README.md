My goal with this website was to build a simple yet appealing page that showcases some of my abilities.<br>
I make use of GitHub pages to host a html script for this website due to it being simple and having good performance while being compatible across most if not all websites and device types.<br>
The project is coded in HTML5 but uses js and css for performance optimization. <br>
